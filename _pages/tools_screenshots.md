Screenshots of the [Palladio Bench](/tools/download/). Palladio comprises graphical and tree-based editors, full Eclipse integration, and in-depth simulation result analysis (either graphical or statistical). For advances statistical analysis, Palladio connects to R.

Each system component and each system resource can be analysis in detail. Hence, high-level system information can be tracked down to individual components and even further to component services (e.g. name server, caching, middleware, or submission of travel expenses) and resources (CPU, hard disk, or network).
