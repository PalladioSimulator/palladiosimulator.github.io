Palladio predicts Quality of Software properties (QoS; e.g. performance and reliability) from software architecture models (the Palladio Component Model, PCM). Analyses enable interactive investigations and optimisations of software architectures (details in the [analysis section](/analysis)).

## What Palladio is

**Palladio** is

- [Free tooling](/tools) (incl. IDE-integrated graphical editors, component model, and simulation engine)
- [Consulting for Industry](/consulting)
- [Science and Research](/science)
- [An open source project](/about/community)

*Palladio* is more than a free powerful IDE for QoS (Quality of Service) prediction based on [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/): It is the foundation of successful software engineering of software architectures with respect to performance, reliabilty, maintainability and costs. The Palladio approach helps avoiding trial-and-error-cycles and supports the creation of scalabe, reliable, and maintainable software architectures at acceptable costs.

*Palladio* [started in 2003](/about/history/) as a research project of the University of Oldenburg and nowadays is a tool-supported software architecture simulation approach which has been successfully applied in industry scenarios and science – worldwide. It is actively developed by [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](http://www.kit.edu/english/), [FZI Research Center for Information Technology](http://www.fzi.de/en), and [Paderborn University](http://www.cs.uni-paderborn.de/). Further [industrial](/consulting/references) and [scientific](/science/partners/#research-partners) partners contribute new cool features.

*Palladio – The Software Quality People* extend the tooling and assist you during the creation or migration of software architectures.
