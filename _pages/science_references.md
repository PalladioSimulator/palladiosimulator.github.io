- **CoCoME**: We successfully modeled the most complex use case from the [CoCoME](http://www.cocome.org/) modeling contest and predicted response times, resource utilisation for different usage scenarios and different system distributions. More information can be found here: [CoCoME](http://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/CoCoME-PCM).
- **Master Thesis**: A master thesis on "Performance Risk Analysis Techniques in early phases of software engineering" evaluated the PCM. The thesis was written at the [Chair of Prof. Dr. Wirsing, LMU Munich](http://www.pst.ifi.lmu.de/).
- **WebAudioStore / MediaStore**: These examples (used in our award-winning WOSP 2007 paper) demonstrate modeling a system comparable to the iTunes store.
- Q-ImPrESS is part of the European Unionâ€™s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). Palladio is here used to predict the performance of services-based architectures.
- [SLA@SOI](http://sla-at-soi.eu/) uses Palladio for predicting the Quality of Service (Performance) of service oriented architectures.
- EU project CloudScale extends Palladio by SimuLizar and cloud scaling support
- EU project CACTOS includes extension of Palladio by energy prediction capabilities and use in computing centres
- [An e-Motions reimplementation](http://atenea.lcc.uma.es/index.php/Main_Page/Resources/E-motions/Palladio) of Palladio transforms Palladio models into e-Motion representations which allow simulation, and formal analysis of real-time systems
- The [LINE LQN Solver](http://line-solver.sourceforge.net/) adds a new Palladio-solver for queueing network models based on ordinary differential equations

Further [industrial references](/consulting/references) are listed separately.
