Palladio supports overall four quality dimensions âˆ’ each with multiple result metrics:

1. **Performance**
    + Response Time
    + Throughput
    + Resource Utilization
2. **Reliability**
    + Probability of failure on demand
3. **Maintainability**
    + Maintenance efforts per design alternative
    + Maintenance costs per design alternative
4. **Costs**
    + Costs for the realisation of a certain software architecture

The support of multple quality dimensions allows informed trade-off decisions (e.g. balance performance and reliability).

All quality dimensions can be analysed based on a single software architecture model (the Palladio Component Model, PCM).
