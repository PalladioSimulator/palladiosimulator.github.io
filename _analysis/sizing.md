## Analyse Sizing Scenarios

Palladio helps in sizing the resource environment: It allows the selection of appropriate execution environments instead of too small or too large execution environments.

With Palladio you can avoid buying too large hardware just for testing purposes and you do not need to find out – after buying it – that a certain hardware or network is too small for your needs.

## Palladio answers your sizing questions

- **Sizing of hardware**: How many servers do we need to support 100 concurrent users?
- **Relocation of running applications**: How does our business application perform on the new servers?
- **Platform selection**: Does my application perform better on a WebSphere or Glassfish application server?
