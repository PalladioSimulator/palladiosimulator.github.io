**Load balancing**, if designed and applied appropriately, enables efficient use of resources and increases reliability. Palladio simulates your software architecture, including your proposal how to load balance, at the design level and predict for example the expectable response time, resource utilisation, throughput, availability, and costs. You can interactively improve your load balancing (e.g. more servers, multiple load balancing levels, combination with cache components) by playing with Palladio models at the design level. 

## Palladio helps to improve you load balancing

- Optimised resource usage (appropriate number of servers) at optimal costs
- Increased throughput and reduced response time
- Maximal availability (e.g. for a given server setup) and evaluations of different fault and failure tolerance mechanisms
